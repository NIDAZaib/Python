    "Nitrogen gas or reactive nitrogen emissions not only agriculture but also from other fields eg traffic or energy sector has to be lessened so that their impact on global warming could be minimized. Even nitrous oxide's impact on global warming is 200 to 300 times more than carbon so that is why its management is important. Also, our food production should not be minimized. Especially in south Asia agricultural involvement is more and industrial countries are less so our main focus should be on agriculture. We are using nitrogenous fertilizers in higher concentrations that is why there is a need to minimize emissions from them. With the help of data science, we should make an inventory that when and how much emissions of nitrous oxide or reactive nitrogen species were there also what is the situation now and what are the future predictions. This is all data science, We can give policy with this data science which information we will collect and real experiment that we will do and on that base, we will give a policy that in future what should Pakistan do and what should other south Asian countries do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Agriculture-related people may know that the United Nations passed a resolution in 2019 in their environment program that nitrogen emissions should be minimized. Their office is in Kenya, Nairobi. In October in Colombo declaration, it was proposed that in 2030 we have to make nitrogen waste half. In the UK during the cope26 Sri Lankan president speech was based on Colombo declarations and I think the nitrogen project is very much connected with data science that you have 8 countries information the information of 50 years back and prediction from that through modeling what will be the scenario in the future and with that we will do experiments in 8 countries that are based upon a similar set of experiments. The work in 8 countries will generate the information that is also data science and upon that there will be modeling and on that base, we will make some decisions or give recommendations so I think today's era is about data science it's everywhere and you can't move without it. Its reason is that life is very fast your communication your sources are very fast that if we will not make decisions on the basis of data science then we will not be able to progress"

    "Sustainable development goals contain no poverty, zero hunger involve agriculture, good health & well being also clean water & sanitation climate action life below water & life on land it is not like that our agriculture is related with it these are dependent upon agriculture so that if you will not perform agriculture precisely then you will make water polluted below the water life will be affected by it also it will affect climate change..so climate change is affecting agriculture and agriculture is affecting climate change. So these 2 things are interdependent and other SDGs are related to agriculture somehow.\n",
    "If we will say there is no poverty now data science is where it comes, or If we say that much food is not producing that will be enough to feed people in this condition where comes data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the real world, its production is enough and more than the requirement then why people are still poor there is still nothing to eat in some areas of Africa or India, and also in some areas of  Pakistan, there is not enough food. What is its reason? The reason is if we will precisely distribute food based on data, the food that is wasteful can be given to those people. We don't have that precision. In agriculture, we say that there is not enough fertilizer eg urea recent scenario so fertilizer unavailability is not overall present but how much you are applying more than half of its is wasteful if you have information precise because precision will come from science and the information which would you collect on that base you will make a precise decision if you would do that then there will be no shortage so on that base I think data science involvement in relation with agriculture and SDGs if we want to achieve them you can see their examples that in this world of data science there is no project without it. They ask language why they ask language even for Ph.D. they are demanding because it is necessary for data science."

    "The purple line is showing a growth rate of the population that is decreasing, but the total population is not decreasing, of course, resources are limited. Resources never become infinite. Our resources in the agricultural land area, for expansion there is nothing, in south Asia there is nothing but in Africa or in South America maybe you will find something but in our south Asia there is no land for expansion. It means we have to use our resources precisely, otherwise, we will not be able to feed our today's populations and the population will be more in the future if you will see this prediction of 2100 that is 7.7 billion and going towards 9.7 billion or going above 10 billion. So it means we have to use our resources precisely and for precise use, we need data science."

    "STEWART et al performed studies in 2005 and he reported 362 seasons of crop production he proposed that 30 to 50 percent production can be attributed to commercial fertilizer inputs. Now see in 2005 situation was this that he said 50 percent by 2030 and double in 30 years so how much commercial fertilizer you should use or if you will use then its impact the resolution which has came that sustainable nitrogen that has to come because the nitrogen you are using is not that much efficient then what is the solution? The solution is that we have to use it precisely. You don't have to only use precision in fertilizer but also in decisions other factors which are affecting agriculture production or growth and reducing agriculture production on that you have to take a precise decision. In taking those precise decisions data science is necessary."

    "Then comes processing, procurement, distribution/retailer, and consumer and their habits, now see my work is on biofortification in which we make cereal enrichment with nutrients now the habit of people is that when a little variation in taste occurs they will not eat it. If there is no consumer then why farmers will produce it, means there is no marketing of it. Farming depends upon the taste of the consumer's mouth. If you are taking a variety of wheat with less gluten which produces stickiness, in our houses we make tortilla but people were not making tortillas with flour of that wheat variety Then there was a variety in which stickiness was much more that was also not suitable for tortilla because people make tortilla with hands and their hands become tired so whenever you don't know the habits of consumers you can not perform distribution. Things are the same but in today's era, you need them more because you cannot afford them. Previously farmers' demands were less, their needs were less, if one crop does not perform well they can bear it. But today they can't tolerate it because the expense on crops is more. If one crop of farmers drops he will be devastated. So I think information in today's era is necessary for them.\n"

Even some special shrubs, before people do mining they decide on the base of those shrubs in that soil which minerals are present in more quantity. One plant is grown specifically in some areas where copper is present in huge amounts. Then they start mining in that area. Crops or other plants are themselves a sensor but you can put sense or machine learning or digital tools or machinery, or by using electric sensor we can collect information.\\\n",
    "Then comes the platform we use all the sense information, we use the software we generate data then comes artificial intelligence, next we do implement and finally, on that, we take actual decisions.

In our country, this kind of policy is not present. Banks in Pakistan are thinking even if we are giving credit to farmers their information should be available or at least for that crop you are giving credit, what should be their weather conditions. If they give this much information then their debit loss chance could be minimized. This is a broader picture of what data science can give us.\n",

Its not possible because soil erosion is happening everywhere it's not happening in mountainous areas it's also occurring in our fields.\n",
